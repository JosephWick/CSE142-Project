**MNIST Unsupervised Clustering Project**

The goal of this project was to create a machine learning algorithm that can accurately cluster like images from the MNIST dataset. 

My algorithm uses the following steps:
1. Feature learning and extraction with a convolutional autoencoder
2. Dimensionality reduction using the tSNE algorithm
3. Clustering on the reduced dimensions with simple kmeans 

Using the data given in class, the algorithm acheived about 96% accuracy in clustering
